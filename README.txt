This code takes mass spec...

The vast majority of this code was written by Mark Grimes (University of Montana) and team,
and has been edited and orginized by Nagashree A. (UM) and McKayl U. (UM). There are three sets
of instructions for this project along with the read me file. One that outlines the code 
pipeline, one that outlines the setup process, and one that gives a brief outline of each 
step in the process for those who are less familiar with the concepts used. Please note that
while most of this code can be run via the command line if needed, a gui is most likely 
required for any .Rmd files. There will also be example SLURM files for submitting the
pipeline.

Cheers,
McKayl
