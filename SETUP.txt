This file covers the setup process for this code. As stated in the README file, the easiest way to reproduce this enviroment
is using the provided .yml file, and to use Anaconda, Miniconda, or a similar alternative. If you need to install one of
these, I would start by looking here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. Once you have them, create a new enviroment
using the command below.
>conda env create -f PTM_Pipeline.yml

This creates an isolated and reproducable enviroment for you to work. It also scales well for HPCs and other more niche
Unix enviroments. Use the conda activate command to summon your new workspace. Below is a brief summary of each function,
what it does, and a few different use cases that you may find helpful. These notes are also available by using the man
command, followed by the command that you want to know more about. After this is created you then can activate it by using
the conda activat command, followed by your enviroment name. 

I want to make a special note as well about STRINGdb. It is an extremely difficult package to install, and for us the installs
from CRAN and Conda did not work. They also contain version inconsistants at the time of writing this. I suggest installing
this package from a tarball as the very last step in this setup process. You can download the tarball from the link below. This
is the only package you will need to install manually.

For a command line version of the command I would use 
>curl -O https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/STRINGdb_2.0.10.tar.gz

Then you can run the command
>tar -xzvf STRINGdb_2.0.10.tar.gz

This will uncompress the package. Then to install it into your enviroment you can run the command
> R CMD INSTALL STRINGdb
