This file covers the setup process for this code. As stated in the README file, the easiest way to reproduce this enviroment
is using the provided .yml file, and to use Anaconda, Miniconda, or a similar alternative. If you need to install one of
these, I would start by looking here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. Once you have them, create a new enviroment
using the command below.

>conda env create -f PTM_Pipeline.yml

This creates an isolated and reproducable enviroment for you to work. It also scales well for HPCs and other more niche
Unix enviroments. Use the conda activate command to summon your new workspace. Below is a brief summary of each function,
what it does, and a few different use cases that you may find helpful. These notes are also available by using the man
command, followed by the command that you want to know more about.
