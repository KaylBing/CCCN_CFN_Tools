# PTMs-to-CCCN-and-CFN
The intent is to make the R functions and RCy3 plotting accessible.
There will be data, there will be graphs, and it will be fun!
We aim to provide the scientific and medical community with something that will help cure cancers.

# Notes from Mark
I tried to include all the relevant functions in Data_Input_Formatting.Rmd, Dissimilarity_Calculations.Rmd, Generate_CCN_CFN.Rmd. Please let me know if any are missing.

I didn't upload the .RData files, which are still on the google drive. The scripts used to generate the data files are: KarenGuolinTenCell.R, KGnegcorredges3.R, PPI_Networks.R.
